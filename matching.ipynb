    "# Matching Students to Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We use will use the following strict requirements:\n",
    "- with every project, we associate a minimum and a maximum possible team size\n",
    "- each team must contain at least one data science skilled student\n",
    "- each team must contain at least one project management skilled student\n",
    "\n",
    "We define whether or not a student is data science (resp. project management) skilled based on their data science score. You can set the threshold above which we classify a student as skilled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model this problem through a mixed integer linear program. For that, let $S$ be the set of students and $P$ be the set of projects. We define $x_{i, j} = 1$ if student $i \\in S$ is assigned to project $j \\in P$, and $x_{i,j} = 0$, otherwise. Hence, $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^{S \\times R}$ is are the decision variables. We clearly need the constraints:\n",
    "- $\\sum_{j \\in P} x_{i,j} = 1$ for all $i \\in S$, which guarantees that every student is assigned to precisely one project\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} \\leq \\operatorname{MAX\\_TEAM\\_SIZE}$ for all $j \\in P$, which quarantees that every project gets assigned a maximum of $\\operatorname{MAX\\_TEAM\\_SIZE}$ students.\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} \\geq \\operatorname{MIN\\_TEAM\\_SIZE}$ for all $j \\in P$, which quarantees that every project gets assigned a minimum of $\\operatorname{MIN\\_TEAM\\_SIZE}$ students.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the data science / project management skilled constraints, we define $d_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for every $i \\in S$, indicating whether student $i$ is data science skilled (in which case $d_i = 1$) or not (in which case $d_i = 0$). Similarly, we define $p_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for every $i \\in S$, indicating whether student $i$ is project management skilled (in which case $p_i = 1$) or not (in which case $p_i = 0$). Note that $d \\in \\{0,1\\}^S$ and $p \\in \\{0,1\\}^S$ can be obtained from the data provided and the thresholds set. We hence impose inequalities:\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} d_i \\geq 1$ for all $j \\in P$\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} p_i \\geq 1$ for all $j \\in P$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find a matching such that every student is assigned to the a project they enjoy (based on the ranking provided by the students) and such that the teams are diverse in terms of gender. Hence, the objective consists of 2 parts: priority and gender diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Objective\n",
    "Each student assigned a score from 1 (most desired project) to 6 (least desired project) to every project. Let $c_{i,j}$ be the score student $i \\in S$ assigned to project $j \\in P$. To make the students happy, we hence wish to minimise\n",
    "$$a = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\sum_{j \\in P} c_{i,j} x_{i,j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender Diversity Objective\n",
    "For every project, we define a gender diversity coefficient $g_j$ for each $j \\in P$ which is simply the absolute value of the difference between the number of females and the number of males assigned to each project. Let us define a binary variable $m_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for every student $i \\in S$, indicating whether student $i$ is male (then $m_i = 1$) or not (then $m_i = 0$). Then we can compute the gener diversity coefficient as follows:\n",
    "$$g_j = \\left| \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} m_i - \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} (1 - m_i) \\right|.$$\n",
    "Note that the minuend is simply the number of males assigned to project $j$ and the subtrahent is the number of females assigned to project $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to minimise \n",
    "$$b = \\sum_{j \\in P} g_j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The above expression for $g_j$ is not linear and can hence not be used for our MIP. We hence impose a slightly weaker set of constraints which look as follows: \n",
    "> $$g_j \\geq \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} m_i - \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} (1 - m_i)$$\n",
    "> $$g_j \\geq -\\left( \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} m_i - \\sum_{i \\in S} x_{i,j} (1 - m_i) \\right)$$\n",
    "> But since we minimise the sum of $g_j$, these constraints are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The complete Objective\n",
    "We hence aim to minimise the combined objective\n",
    "$$a + b = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\sum_{j \\in P} c_{i,j} x_{i,j} + \\sum_{j \\in P} g_j$$\n"
