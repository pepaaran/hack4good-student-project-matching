# Hack4Good Matching Students to Projects

The aim of this notebook is to assign students to the NGO-Projects. Find detailed descriptions on how this is achieved in the notebook itself. 

I recommend setting up a virtual Python environment and installing the packages in the `requirements.txt` file. Since the `mip` package for Mixed Integer Programming in not available for `conda`, you should use `pip`.
```
conda create -n h4genv
conda activate h4genv
pip install numpy==1.23.3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
